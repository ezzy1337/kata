# Kata
There are a ton of online coding Dojos; CodeWars, HackerRank etc. and kata are common place in technical interviews.
Most often the kata presented in an interview are academic in nature despite the fact most developers do not use these
concepts outside of their academic careers. This repo houses some academic kata that will help developers prepare for
kata presented in coding interviews by providing a unit tests verifying the common data strcutures, some of their algorithms
while requiring/teaching good OO principles and code organization.


## Structure
Data structures, algorithms, SOLID design principles, and OO transcend any on programming language and as a polyglot I want to teach
these concepts in various languages so there is a folder for each supported language that provides the unit tests you should use. Each
folder contains it's own README with language specific setup as well as a list of tools needed for running the unit tests.


## Topics
Covered topics are listed in order from easiest to most challenging.
 1. Linked List
    1. Doubly Linked List
    2. Circular Linked List
 3. Heaps
 4. Hash Table
 5. Trees
    1. Binary Search Tree
    2. B Tree
 6. Graphs
    1. Single Source Shortest Path
        1. Djikstra algorithm
        2. Pim's algorithm


## Contributing
I would love additional language contributions. I plan on providing tests in Python, C#, javascript (node.js), but Golang and Rust would be awesome.
This project aims to be a framework for teaching new developers so documentation, READMEs and clean code are essential.
