# Kata
There are a ton of online coding Dojos; CodeWars, HackerRank etc. and kata are common place in technical interviews.
Most often the kata presented in an interview are academic in nature despite the fact most developers do not use these
concepts outside of their academic careers. This repo houses some academic kata that will help developers prepare for
kata presented in coding interviews by providing a unit tests verifying the common data strcutures, some of their algorithms
while requiring/teaching good OO principles and code organization.


## Structure
Data structures, algorithms, Test-Driven-development, SOLID design principles, and OO transcend any programming language. As a
self proclaimed polyglot I want to teach these concepts in various language. You will find a folder for each of the concepts
containing a README that explains the data structure, covers algorithmic complexity and explores some algorithms that use that
data structure. Every concept folder will have language specific subfolders (i.e. python, node, C#) etc. containing everything
you need to get started including a README, requirements files, and most importantly unit tests.


## Topics
Covered topics are listed in order from easiest to most challenging.

 4. Hash Table
 5. Trees
    1. Binary Search Tree
    2. B Tree
 6. Graphs
    1. Single Source Shortest Path
        1. Djikstra algorithm
        2. Pim's algorithm


## Contributing
I would love additional language contributions. I plan on providing tests in Python, C#, javascript (node.js), but Golang and Rust would be awesome.
This project aims to be a framework for teaching new developers so documentation, READMEs and clean code are essential.
