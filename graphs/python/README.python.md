# Python Graphs
## Getting Started
You will be implementing 2 classes in this exercise Graph and its subclass Node. The
class definitions and \_\_init\_\_ method signatures have been provided for you. 


## Running The Tests
The following command will run all of the graph tests.
```
pytest -x graphs/
```
_NOTE: using `-x` is recommended so you can follow a flow similar to test driven development._
